## Backend to the Face Finder app

This backend receives responses from the API. It routes login information to the PostgreSQL database and API responses. The server is built with Node, thus offering non-blocking runtime, and Express for routing http requests.

The PostgreSQL database has 2 tables to ensure security and the password is encrypted.
